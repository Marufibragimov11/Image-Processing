# 🖼️ Image-Processing

Welcome to my **Image Processing** repository! This is a dedicated space where I document my learning journey, experiments, and implementations of computer vision algorithms.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This repository serves as a digital lab notebook. As I progress from basic pixel manipulations to complex computer vision tasks, I'll be uploading scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and sample results here.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
* Master **spatial domain** processing (filtering, histograms).
* Understand **frequency domain** analysis (Fourier Transforms).
* Implement classic algorithms from scratch before using libraries like **OpenCV**.
* Prepare for advanced topics like **Deep Learning** and **Object Detection**.

## 🚀 Roadmap & Progress
I am following a structured path to master the field. Here is where I stand:

| Module | Status | Highlights |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01. Basics** | ✅ Completed | Loading images, Color spaces (RGB/HSV), Resizing |
| **02. Histograms** | 🏃 In Progress | Equalization, Contrast stretching, Matching |
| **03. Filters** | ⏳ Planned | Gaussian blur, Median filter, Sobel/Canny Edge detection |
| **04. Transforms** | ⏳ Planned | Hough Transform, Affine/Perspective shifts |
| **05. Segmentation** | ⏳ Planned | Thresholding, K-Means, Contours |
